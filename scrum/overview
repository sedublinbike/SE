1.1	Introduction
Dublin Bike is a public bicycle rental scheme which has operated in the city of Dublin since 2009. As a user-friendly software, Dublin Bike Monitor is mainly used to monitor, analyze and predict the Dublin Bike availability based on the historical data and give guidance for user on their travel plan.
All of the code/graph/notes are available on GITHUB at: https://github.com/sedublinbike/SE

1.5	Structure


1.6	Feature
1)	Cloud-based: This software deploys all the program and data on the AWS RDS and EC2 running 24/7.
2)	Chart-vitalization: Chart is widely used in our software to give users a direct and clear picture of the distribution and different color of the marker to show the different availability of each station.
3)	Accurate predict model: We achieve 80% accuracy rate after trying dour different model.
